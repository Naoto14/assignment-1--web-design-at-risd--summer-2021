        <h4>Salvador Dalí</h4>
          <p>Salvador Dalí, in full Salvador Felipe Jacinto Dalí y Domenech,
            (born May 11, 1904, Figueras, Spain—died January 23, 1989, Figueras),

        <h4>David Carson</h4>
          <p>David Carson is a man who has transformed the field of graphic design
            throughout his career. Self-taught, resolutely grid-free, and unafraid
            to speak his mind (he’s also very funny), Carson’s work made designers
            realise that editorial layouts didn’t have to stick to the rules around
            image placement, consistent typography, or doggedly flowing copy issue
            after issue.</p>
